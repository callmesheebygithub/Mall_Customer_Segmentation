# Mall_Customer_Segmentation
I am thrilled to share that I have successfully developed a powerful Unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) model! 🤖📈

The model was trained using a diverse dataset of mall customers, containing essential features like 'Genre', 'Age', 'Annual Income (k$)', and 'Spending Score (1-100)'. Through the magic of data preprocessing and categorical-to-numerical conversion, we harnessed the potential of these features to build a robust predictive tool.

The ML model utilized the K-means clustering algorithm 📊 to group mall customers based on their similarities. The elbow method was employed to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring we obtain meaningful and actionable insights.

We then plotted the customer data in 4D 🌌, incorporating age, annual income, spending score, and gender. The interactive visualization showcased distinct clusters, revealing unique customer segments and trends.

But that's not all! The model is now fully operational and can even predict which cluster a new customer belongs to! 🎯 By inputting customer details, the model accurately identifies the most suitable cluster for personalized marketing and better customer engagement.

I'm incredibly proud of this achievement and can't wait to leverage the ML model to drive data-driven decisions and take our mall's customer experience to the next level. 🛍️💡
